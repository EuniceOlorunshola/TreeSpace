# TreeSpace

# Description on this project

As a graduate student worked with a team to complete this project for my advanced algorithms in Bioinformatics class. It contains a documentation folder that shows my research paper in IEEE format, and my presentation file which goes over the overview of my paper. It also contains a scripts folder that shows the three script files that we created in R using R-Studio.

# Descriptions on  the scripts:
**generateTreeScript.R** : 
This script generates phylogenetic trees, plots them, computes distances between them, and saves the trees and 
distance data to files in the directory path specified. 

**r_visualize_bioinformatics.R** :
This script reads a phylogenetic tree file, visualizes the tree using the library ggtree then it adds some customization to the tree plot, such as changing the layout and adding tip labels.

**sampleTreeScript.R** :
This script was used as a sample to demonstrate the generation of random phylogenetic trees, visualization of the trees, and calculation of the distance between them using the distory package.

# Directions to access the scripts:

The scripts was coded in RStudio which is the source code editor that I recommended to use to run the scripts, but other editors can be used as well such as visual studio code, PyCharm, and jupyter notebook.
